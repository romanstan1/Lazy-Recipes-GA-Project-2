### GA WDI London - Project 2, Lazy Recipe

Lazy Recipes is a recipe finding application that is built with Node.js and Express. The concept is simple - a user can upload images of food or browse existing images and then view recipes that can be cooked using the food in that image.

The application uses an impressive image recognition API provided by Clarifai and a recipe finding API provided by Food2Fork.
